    q: `Where is Code Overload being held and what format?`,
    a: `Code Overload will be held in-person at Roslyn High School for the first time since 2017. In the first half of the event, the board will be teaching workshops involving three different areas of computer science to provide inspiration for potential project ideas. The second half will be used to work together with your team to develop an idea into a functional project that will be presented to the judges.`,
  },
  {
    q: `Do I need to create a project based on the workshops?`,
    a: `No, the workshops are to provide inspiration if you can't think of a project. However, it's recommended that you attend them anyways so you can learn something new.`,
  },
  {
    q: `Can I work solo?`,
    a: `You can, although it's not recommended. Hackathons are more fun when you're learning together!`,
  },
  {
    q: `How are winners decided?`,
    a: `The Code Club Board will serve as a judging panel and determine winners using different criteria for an assortment of categories.`,
