## Workshop 1: Introduction to CTFs

Hi, this is Stanley! We've previously focused on topics and languages that are with the typical realm of software engineering, but for this workshop, we are exploring the realm of cybersecurity!

Cybersecurity is a field closely related to software engineering; it involves the security of everything that goes on digitally, whether that be transactions, passwords, or access to a group of resources.

To start, we'll be signing up for [Cyberstart America](https://www.cyberstartamerica.org/), which is a free online resource to learn about cybersecurity. In the upcoming workshops, we'll be going over different types of CTFs.

Some things to keep in mind:
- CTFs are hard to start. You'll likely find it hard to understand what to look for or what to solve. This is completely normal; experience is key!
- Not all platforms are equal: most CTFs will require you to be very familiar with Linux (specifically the terminal), with a substantial amount of them **requiring** Linux in order to solve the problems.
    - While you can use an emulator for a Linux terminal, it may not be an optimal experience when it comes to competing. I highly recommend learning the Linux terminal and its commands.
- CTFs are not meant to be solved by yourself! While it would be great for you to be able to solve every type of category, it's relatively unrealistic; create a team, each member being proficient in a different topic to cover the greatest amount of topics!


### What are CTFs?
CTF stands for "capture the flag", but instead of capturing a physical flag, a flag is represented by a particular string template. Typically in competitions, this would be the name of the competition with a unique set of characters and numbers between two brackets.

Examples:
picoCTF{ra0fkga0kg402kh4h0k3rh}
ABCXYZ{aser9hjw0e9rjh3095j}
roslynCTF{e0rgw0ehw3h0dg}
```

### How do I learn to get good at CTFs?
CTFs are best learned through experience with a variety of different topics. For instance, the more computer literate you are, the better chance you may have navigating certain problems. Prevalent topics include web exploitation, cryptography, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and much more.
