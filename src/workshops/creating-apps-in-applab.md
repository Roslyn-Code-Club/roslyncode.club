### Go to code.org
##### 1. If you already have an account, just use that one. If not, just create an account.
##### 2. Click on "projects" on the top.
##### 3. Select App Lab.
##### **This app will be coded in javascript**


### Start to try and think of a good idea for an app you have, it can literally be anything!!!
##### Once you have decided on your topic, you can start looking through the different types of blocks that App Lab offers to code with.
##### If you are unsure what a block can do, you can drag your mouse over it and it will describe what the block does. Also, it can show you an example of the block being used.


### I highly recommend starting out with decorating the app itself and gathering all the images you need and then getting to the actual coding aspect of it.
To do this, go to the design part of the app lab and feel free to play around with all different designs you can put on your app. You can add images, buttons, text areas, etc.

After you are done with the design part of your app, you can begin coding it. Feel free to code using either the blocks or writing it out in text.

### HAVE FUN WITH THIS AND MAKE A GREAT APP!!! THE IDEAS ARE ENDLESS!!!!
